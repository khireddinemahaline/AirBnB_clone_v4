# AirBnb Console Project:
## First Step : The console
1. creat data model
2. manage (create, update, destroy, etc..) via the console
3. store and presist objects to (json file)
## description of the project
Serialization and deserialization are two important concepts in programming that allow objects to be easily stored, transmitted, and reconstructed. Theyâ€™re used in various scenarios, such as storing objects in a database, sending objects over a network, or caching objects in memory
#### Files and Directory 

AirBnB_clone : the main reposotry for the project
	models : directory containt all classes and module files (object/instance)
		- base_model.py : file contain the base class of all our module
			* attributes : id , created_at , update_at
			* methods : save() , to_json()  
	test   : directory contain all unit test file 
	models/engine : diectory will contain all storage class  
		- file_storage.py (only one file for this project)
	
	= console.py >>> file the entry point of our comand interpreter

## description of the command interpreter: 

start console.py so you could manipilate with interpreter
#### What's a command interpreter?

Do you remember the Shell? It's exactly the same but limited to a specific use-case. In our case, we want to be able to manage the objects of our project:

    Create a new object (ex: a new User or a new City)
    Retrieve an object from a file
    Do operations on objects (create, destroy, all, etc...)
    Update attributes of an object

-- you could start your command interpreter in tow way 
1. interactive mode
guillaume@ubuntu:~/AirBnB$ python3 -m unittest discover tests

2. non-interactive mode:
guillaume@ubuntu:~/AirBnB$ echo "python3 -m unittest discover tests" | bash
